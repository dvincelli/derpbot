Bart: KWYJIBO. K-W-Y-J-I-B-O. Twenty-two points. Plus triple word score. Plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game’s over, I’m outta here.
Homer: Wait a minute, you little cheater! You’re not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is.
Bart: Kwyjibo. Ah… a big dumb balding North American ape. With no chin.
Marge: And a short temper.
Homer: I’ll show you a big dumb balding ape!
Bart: Uh oh, kwyjibo on the loose!
%
Bart: Look everybody, I would just as soon not make a big deal out of this. I’m not saying I’m not a hero, I’m just saying that I fear for my safety.
%
Bart: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, contrary to what you’ve just seen, war is neither glamorous or fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars. With the following exceptions: the American Revolution, World War II and Star Wars trilogy.
%
Bart: Look in my eyes. See the conviction? See the sincerity? See the fear? As God is my witness, I can pass the fourth grade!
Homer: And if you don’t, at least you’ll be bigger than the other kids.
%
Mrs. Krabappel: What’s the matter? Well I would think you’d be used to failing by now.
Bart: No, you don’t understand! I really tried this time! I mean I really tried.
Mrs. Krabappel: There there.
Bart: This is as good as I can do! And I still failed!
Mrs. Krabappel: Well, a 59. It’s a high F.
Bart: Who am I kidding? I really am a failure! Oh, now I know how George Washington felt when he surrendered Fort Necessity to the French in 1754.
%
Homer: We’re proud of you, Boy.
Bart:Thanks Dad. Part of this d-minus belongs to God.

Lisa: Mom, I poured my heart into that centerpiece. Things like that always happen in this family.

Marge: Did you make any money?
Bart: Not yet but I’m in a lot of pain.

Rabbi Hyman Krustofski (Jackie Mason): Oh, what can I do for you my young friends?
Bart: We came to talk to you about your son.
Rabbi Krustofski: I have no son! {he slams the door}
Bart: Oh great. We came all this way and it’s the wrong guy.
Rabbi Krustofski: I didn’t mean that literally!
%
Bart: Rabbi, did not a great man say—and I quote, “The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I’ve heard of persecution but what they went through is ridiculous. But the great thing is, after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it.” End quote.
Rabbi Krustofski: Oh, I never heard the plight of my people phrased so eloquently. Who said that? Rabbi Hillel?

Bart: No.
Rabbi Krustofski: Maimonides.
Bart: No.
Rabbi Krustofski: Oh, I got it. The Dead Sea Scrolls!

Bart: Gotcha. Can’t win, don’t try.
%
Bart: If you don’t watch the violence you’ll never get desensitized to it.

Bart: We’re all going to die, Lis.
Lisa: I meant soon.
Bart: So did I.
%
Bart: Alright, that’s it. I’ve been scorched by Krusty before. I got a rapid heartbeat from those Krusty Brand vitamins. My Krusty Kalculator didn’t have a seven or an eight. And Krusty’s autobiography was self-serving, with many glaring omissions. But this time, he’s gone too far!
%
With the church doors frozen shut, Lisa starts praying.
Bart: Lisa, this is neither the time nor the place.

Mrs. Krabappel: Very good. Thank you, Bart.
Bart: Oh don’t thank me. Thank an unprecedented eight year military build-up.

Bart: Mom, when you give that lecture, you’re boring Springfield.
%
%
Bart: Come on, Milhouse. There’s no such thing as a soul. It’s just something they made up to scare kids. Like the boogeyman or Michael Jackson.
