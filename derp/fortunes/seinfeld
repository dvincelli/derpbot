G: I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become
   hopeless. When you're hopeless you don't care. And when you
   care, that indifference makes you attractive.
J: So, hopelessness is the key?
G: It's my only hope.

Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come
from a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather
was a quitter...
I was raised to give up.

You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit
someone better than me. I'm no good!

'It's not you, it's me....'? You're giving me the 'It's not you, it's
me' routine? I invented 'It's not you, it's me.' Nobody tells me it's
them, not me. If it's anybody, it's me.

For me to ask a woman out, I've got to get into a mental state like the

Instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to
have over 360 pair. That way I only have to do wash once a year.

You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave
me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.

All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because they are
fathers.  Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his
attitude is, "To hell with the world, I can make my own people. I'll eat
whatever I want. I'll wear whatever I want, and I'll create whoever
I want."
